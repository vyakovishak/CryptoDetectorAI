Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.\n\nThe master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin. If you would like to help test the Bitcoin core, please contact QA@Bitcoin.org.\n\nFeature branches are created when there are major new features being worked on by several people."

Add following SBT dependency:\n\n`\"net.liftweb\" % \"lift-json_2.10\" % \"2.5-M4\"`\n\nor download and put jar to appropriate folder etc.\n\n\nSpecs2 framework used for testing, add following dependency for it :\n\n`\"org.specs2\" %% \"specs2\" % \"1.14\" % \"test\"`\n\n(not needed if you use PlayFramework 2.x)\n\nHow to Use the Client\n---------------------\n\n(more info [in my blog](http://chepurnoy.org/blog/2013/04/scala-clients-for-btc-e-trade-and-public-data-apis-my-first-opensource-released/))\n\nTo set credentials, create own implementation of ClientCredentials trait:\n\n    object MyClientCredentials extends ClientCredentials {\n        val Key = \"my key\"\n        val Secret = \"my secret\"\n    }\n\nBy default, WS library from Play framework is used for HTTP requests. To replace \nit, implement abstract functions *getRequest* (for Market Data API Client), *signedPostRequest* (for Trade API Client), *releaseConnections* (if needed) from HttpApiClient trait\nand make own trade API and market data API implementations as:\n\n`class MyTradeApiClient(credentials: ClientCredentials) extends TradeApiClient(credentials) with MyHttpApiClient`\n\nand\n\n`class MyMarketDataApiClient extends MarketDataApiClient with MyHttpApiClient`\n\n\nMore info [in my blog][]\n\nWeak points\n-----------\n\n* Current version extracts only funds information from *getInfo* method results\n* Only WS HTTP library (from Play framework) supported now. But it's easy to work with an another\n\nDonations\n---------\n\nPlease, support my work:\n\nBTC: 1DLFrNmQboQmZzo9aPKrcrJkLtXKh2hQuU\n\nLTC: LS5D18dfqQVUqSGVsYCinwvTuwUZ9FJ89V\n\n"

        "readme": "Open Transactions: Server, Smart, and Currency Contracts\n=============================================\n\nThe goal is to create a variety of server and currency contracts, along with several different kinds of smart contracts. These contracts can then be used to trade, for example: digital gold grams, digital silver grams, and \n\"digital\" bitcoin, as well as other valuable currencies and commodities across many different servers\u2014complimented by smart contracts. The vision is for these servers to be low-trust and federated: securing, transferring, and releasing currencies with zero risk.\n\nSee: https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions\n\n###What's been done, and what I'm working on\n\nI currently have two basic currency contracts: <a href=\"https://github.com/stretch/OT-Contracts/blob/master/currency-contracts/digigold.xml\">Digital Gold Grams</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/stretch/OT-Contracts/blob/master/currency-contracts/digisilver.xml\">Digital Silver Grams</a>; I would like to develop these currency \ncontracts\u2014as well as all of this project's future contracts\u2014into proper technical and legal documents \nthat can be used on for-profit servers.\n\n###Completed and working on:\n* Completed: basic <a href=\"https://github.com/stretch/OT-Contracts/blob/master/currency-contracts/digisilver.xml\">Digital Silver Grams</a> currency contract\n* Completed: basic <a href=\"https://github.com/stretch/OT-Contracts/blob/master/currency-contracts/digigold.xml\">Digital Gold Grams</a> currency contract\n* Working on: hosting basic public server\n* Working on: publishing basic public server contract\n\n###How to use sample data\n\nCopy the contents of the /sample-data directory into your ~/.ot directory and then launch Open Transactions.\n\n###Smart Contracts\n\nThe first smart contract I would like to work on would be used to exchange bitcoins for \"digital\" bitcoins, or \"digiBTC\". The smart contract could be used on a webpage, server, or within a mobile app to record the client's \nwallet address and requested amount of digiBTC, the smart contract would then monitor and await a single blockchain \nconfirmation (or however many confirmations are set in the contract) of the transfer; once confirmed the smart contract \nwould tell the server to issue the digiBTC to the client. The whole operation would be reversed to exchange digiBTC for \nbitcoin.\n\n###How to create a currency contract\n\nCreating a currency contract is simple: first, create or open a sample .xml file, then state your conditions and \nattach your nym's public key (find this by using the \"exportcert\" command in the opentxs CLI, or in the\n~/.ot/client_data/certs/ directory) in the < key name=\"contract\" > area like this:\n\n    <!-- KEYS -->\n\n    <key name=\"contract\">\n    -

A PoW function is\ncostly (CPU time or RAM size) to compute, slowing down a DoS attack.\nThe returned IPs are randomized within 64-bits of the IPv6 address space\nand each returned IP is tied to the requesting client &mdash; malicious\nclients may not share resolved IPs to circumvent the system.\n\nPlease see `docs/project_proposal.md` for more information.\n\nWhat works right now?\n=====================\n\nA very rough, prototype implementation of the idea is underway. A Twisted-based\nDNS server is able to issue a PoW challenge and check the response before\nreturning a random IPv6 address. A Twisted-based resolver is provided to test\nthe server.\n\nWhat remains to be done?\n========================\n\n * Implement the new resolver in glibc to allow unmodified program to use SlothNS\n * Have the server register random resolved IPs with the system firewall to allow\n   access to the protected service\n\nWho is doing it?\n================\n\nThe project authors are Nina Baker and Jevin Sweval.\n\nWhy are you doing it?\n=====================\n\nThis project is for our [Fault-Tolerant Computer System Design class] [course_page]\nat Purdue University.\n\n[course_page]: https://engineering.purdue.edu/ee695b/public-web/\n\n"

        "readme": "A TurboGears 2 inspired full stack framework for Node.js written in CoffeeScript.\nStill heavily under progress, but someone might find this one actually useful already.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nI have been using TurboGears 2.0 / Pylons infrastructure on Python recently; I have noticed\nmany shortcomings in the existing Node.js frameworks. None of the projects fulfilled my needs, \nso I had to roll out yet another framework. Most notable deficiencies in all existing frameworks\nwere\n\n-   None really supported configuration files. In Pylons/TurboGears, the full stack\n    can be configured in the configuration file. This has the advantage of rolling out\n    a slightly different configuration for testing by just changing the startup configuration \n    file.\n\n-   Seriously speaking, the pattern-dispatch url routing (invented by RoR?) is the most brain \n    damaged pattern ever. TurboGears 2.0 provided an alternative, whereby a part of hierarchy\n    would be mapped to a class or a class instance, with its methods as the verbs. This allows\n    one to construct complex hierarchies, and mount some hierarchies to multiple locations,\n    without any code reuse.\n\n    Suppose your system has two kinds of commentable objects: users and articles. You\n    can then have a single CommentController mapped to both /user/123/comments and \n    /article/456/comments, with slightly differing semantics; but other routing would\n    not need to know the url hierarchy below the comments portion\n\n-   No existing framework supported internationalization, period. Yeah, some projects did \n    claim they do it, but no. No gettext support, no proper embedding in templates, nothing.\n    The translatable strings need to be there where they are used. None of the existing \n    frameworks did support this though\n\n-   Many embedded template frameworks did not support effortless async rendering! What \n    is the point in having the complexity of asynchronous language if you cannot throw\n    some promises to your template?\n\n-   Reinvent the wheel. Many frameworks roll out their half-assed tools and templating\n    languages etc. Robusta is built on Express and tries to use it as much as possible.\n    The template engine is Dust, whose syntax is a bit awkward and it is quite far from\n    such a gem as Genshi, but it was the only sane engine available that would allow us \n    to roll out i18n support and would support asynchronous rendering. \n\n\nGoals\n=====\n\nThe goals of this project are to include the following features:\n\n-   url routing by traversing property graph (implemented).\n-   extendable, yet easy, server configuration using subclassing (started).\n-   pluggable mechanisms for authentication, sessions, caching, etc. (well\n    you might use express facilities for now)\n-   embedded i18n both in the client side scripts and on the server side. \n-   MO/PO files compiled to JSON\n-   currently achievable with the attached python tool\n-   integrated templating with full support for promises. (using dust)\n-   extensive debugging support.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n-   Express framework  (http://expressjs.com/)\n-   CoffeeScript 1.0 (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)\n-   Dust (http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/)\n\nRunning the example\n===================\n\n-   run \"npm link\" in the package.json directory\n-   change to example subdirectory and run \"robusta serve\" (it defaults to 'development.ini')\n-   go to http://localhost:8000/ and enjoy\n"

        "readme": "# Node-RPC-Socket.io - Implementation of JSON-RPC over socket.io\n\n  It's easy to use socket.io, but it work only in one way : server to client or client to server.\n  JSON-RPC is a standard that allow a client to ask an answer from the server, with standard JSON structure for request and response. With socket.io, the server can also call an RPC answer from the client.\n  \n  Currently, I've only made a client package for websites in javascript, but I'm working on a full cocoa implementation of the client for iOS or OSX apps. Coming soon...\n  \n## Features\n\n  - Very simple to use\n  - Client can ask Server but Server can also ask Client\n  - Asynchronous callbacks\n  - *NEW* Success or error response can be passed through other callbacks \n  - Exceptions are fully compatible with the JSON-RPC standard and can be interpreted by the `Error callback` client side (or server side)\n  - Can also Broadcast an RPC message to all clients or all with exceptions (in this way, no response can be handled by the server, it works only like a notification)\n  - Compatible all webbrowsers since ie5.5 (same compatibility as socket.io)\n  \n## Tutorial / Example\n\nI've included an example of a chat (yes another one, I know :P), this chat is based on express.js with jade and stylus.\n\n\n```\n  git clone git://github.com/Tronix117/node-rpc-socket.io.git\n  cd node-rpc-socket.io/example\n  npm install -i\n  node app.js\n```\n\nThen go, in more than one tab of your webbrowser, to this url : `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and enjoy !\nFiles are commented and should be simple to understand.  \n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequiste\n\nYou first need to install socket.io \n\n    npm install -i socket.io\n\n### Client-Side\n\n```html\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/socket.io/socket.io.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/javascripts/rpc.socket.io.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Server-Side\n```javascript\n  var io = require('rpc.socket.io.js');\n```\nIt's not necessary to require `socket.io`, in fact `rpc.socket.io.js` already include it.\n\n## Use\n\n### Server-Side\n\n```javascript\n  //function used later, you can jump after and let's come back when it'll be called\n  var checkAuthz = function(params,client,next){\n    if(!params.password || !params.user || params.user!='admin' || params.password!='toor')\n      throw new {code:'UNAUTHORIZED',message:'Your are not enough powerfull to access to this information'};\n    return next(); //pass throught the next callback function (the one just bellow) and return it\n  }\n\n  var socket = io.listen(app); //app is the server created with http.createServer or the express.createServer of express.js\n  socket.on('connection', function(client){\n    //here, there's a new client, it's time to listen to the call of a method from the client\n    \n    //First of all, we are going to send the current time when the client will request \"getRemoteTime\"\n    client.listenRPC('getRemoteTime',checkAuthz, /*for checkAuthz see at the top*/\n      function(params){\n        return (new Date()).getTime();\n      }\n    );\n    \n    //We send a banner to the client\n    client.callRPC('banner',{time:(new Date()).getTime(), message:'Welcome to you !'});\n    \n    //We send an information message to all OTHER clients\n    client.broadcastNotifyRPC('notification',{code:'NEWUSER', message:'A new user is connected'});\n  });\n```\n\n### Client-Side\n\n```javascript\n  var socket = new io.Socket('127.0.0.1'), //address and port of the websocket server, check socket.io for more help\n      showNotification = function(notif){\n        alert(notif.message);\n      };\n  \n  socket\n    .listenRPC('banner', function(params){\n      if(params.time && params.message)\n        alert(params.message);\n    })\n    .listenRPC('notification',showNotification);\n  \n  document.getElementById('btn').onClick=function(){\n    socket.callRPC('getRemoteTime',{user:'admin', password:'toor'},{\n      success: function(result){\n        alert('The remote time is ' + result);\n      },\n      error: function(err){\n        switch(err.code){\n          case 'UNAUTHORIZED':\n            alert(err.message);\n          break;\n          case 'CALLRPCTIMEOUT':\n            alert('Please check your network, server doesn\\'t seem to respond');\n          break;\n          default:\n            alert('Unknown Error !');\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n    });\n  }\n  \n  //finaly we launch the socket\n  socket.connect();\n```\n\n### Running\n\nNow let's start the server and open a webbrowser window on the client-side page. Normaly, once time the client is loaded and connected, the server must send a `banner` method to the client and the client will print in an alert box the `params.message`. If we open a new tab on the same page in the webbrowser, the first one will show a new alert, the `notification` one, saying that a new user is connected. If we click on a button with the `id` = `btn`, then the `callRPC('getRemoteTime')` will be reach and the server will respond with the correct time and the `success` callback will be fire. If we change the `password` to another, the server will throw an error, and it's the `error` callback which will be fired.\n\n## API\n\n### Server-Side\n\n#### client.callRPC(methodName, [params, [callback/options]])\n  Get the result of the method `methodName` from the client side.\n\n  The third argument can be the success callback or an option parameter like bellow :\n      options = {\n        timeout: 8000,\n        cleanCallbacksOnTimeout: true, //recommended\n        success: null, //fired when a result come from the client\n        error: null, //fired if the client has thrown an error, or a timeout has occured\n        finaly: null //fired either in case of success or error\n      }\n      \n#### client.listenRPC(methodName, methodToRun[, methodToRun2[, ...])\n  Listen for a callRPC coming from the client, if client call `methodName`, then methodToRun will be fired and the result will be returned to the client.\n  \n  methodToRun is called with three parameters : methodToRun(params, client, next, result)\n  * params : parameters the client has sent\n  * client : which client has sent the call (then we can use it for client.callRPC() from example)\n  * next : method which call the next methodToRun, don't forget to precede it by `return` if you want that the result be the one of the next methodToRun : `return next();`\n  * result : *NEW* very usefull new stuff, you can pass this method through others structures, `result.error(object)` return an error to the client rpc call and `result.success(object)` return a success\n  \n  In the methodToRun, you can make `throw {code:'XXX',message:'Xxx xxx'}` structure, which will be interpreted correctly by the client. The `return` will be send in response to the client.\n  \n#### client.broadcastNotifyRPC(method,params)\n  Similar to callRPC, except the fact that the callRPC will act like a notification and will be send to all other clients (except the current one : `client`).\n  Warning, no result can be attended.\n  \n#### [client.]listener.broadcastNotifyRPC(method,params, except)\n  Similar to client.broaddcastNotifyRPC, but it will send to ALL clients except those specified in the `except` parameter.\n\n#### [client.]listener.broadcastCallRPC(method,params, callback, except)\n  Similar to listener.broadcastNotifyRPC, but this time, a callback can be passed to handle each client result, in this case callback(result, client) will be called for each client\n  \n### Client-Side\n\n#### socket.callRPC(methodName, [params, [callback/options]])\n  Get the result of the method `methodName` from the server side.\n\n  The third argument can be the success callback or an option parameter like bellow :\n      options = {\n        timeout: 8000,\n        cleanCallbacksOnTimeout: true, //recommended\n        success: null, //fired when a result come from the client\n        error: null, //fired if the client has thrown an error, or a timeout has occured\n        finaly: null //fired either in case of success or error\n      }\n      \n#### socket.listenRPC(methodName, methodToRun[, methodToRun2[, ...])\n  Listen for a callRPC coming from the server, if client call `methodName`, then methodToRun will be fired and the result will be returned to the server.\n  \n  methodToRun is called with three parameters : methodToRun(params, client, next)\n  * params : parameters the server has sent\n  * next : method which call the next methodToRun, don't forget to precede it by `return` if you want that the result be the one of the next methodToRun : `return next();`\n  \n  In the methodToRun, you can make `throw {code:'XXX',message:'Xxx xxx'}` structure, which will be interpreted correctly by the server. The `return` will be send in response to the server."

It has separate classes for configuring a Director, one or more Storage Daemons and File Daemons (Clients) along with the bconsole and bat programs (for local workstations).\n\nYou can manage multiple networks of Bacula within an operation should you require, however each Storage Daemon, File Daemon and Console/BAT can only be configured with a single Director. In theory this will probably be enough for most networks.\n\n\nLICENCE\n-------\n\npuppet-bacula is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\npuppet-bacula is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

There is nothing within it allow it to work between different distributions at this time. Feel free to submit changes to allow this to function across different distributions as required.\n * This configuration will also operate using SQLite3 only. At this point its been designed to work with a simple network, as so SQLite3 will be enough for this time. Feel free to submit additions to help with MySQL and/or PostgreSQL.\n * Fill in anything in this documentation I've forgotten about...\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n=============\n\nThere are two steps to the configuration of Bacula using this module:\n\n 1. Configure the Envionment Variables to define what will be backing up and to where, which which passwords and reporting to whom.\n 2. Configure the nodes with the required classes to act as the different parts of the network.\n\nThe environment variables are as follows:\n\n```ruby\n$bacula_server_password  = \"random_password_one_goes_here\"\n$bacula_console_password = \"random_password_two_goes_here\"\n$bacula_director_server  = \"director.bacula.local\"\n$bacula_storage_server   = \"storage.bacula.local\"\n$bacula_mail_to          = \"example@example.com\"\n```\n\nThe only one that isn't required is the last one - if not yet, the e-mails will simply be sent to 'root' by default. If you require something more useful, set it with this.\n\nOtherwise, the variables are fairly simple - set the FQDN of the Director which will manage backing up across the network, along with the FQDN of the Storage Daemon which the servers will back up to. You can have as many Storage Daemons as you require, configured as you see fit. For example, you could have the master one if the global namespace, then override servers individually, or in groups through the inherit mechinism.\n\nThe Director must also have a Storage Daemon listed as this is the default Storage Deamon for all jobs (overriden as required by each of the nodes to be backed up) and also will be the Storage Daemon to which the Catalog/Database will be backed up.\n\n```ruby\n$bacula_backup_dohome    = 'No'                          # 'Yes' or 'No'\n$bacula_backup_onday     = 'Saturday'                    # Days of the Week\n# You can also extend the include/exclude lists on a per-node or groups-of-nodes basis:\n$bacula_backup_includes  = ['/path/one', '/path/two']    # Default is Empty\n$bacula_backup_excludes  = ['/path/three', '/path/four'] # Default is Empty\n```\n\nThese variables are optional, with the defaults as shown. If you want to spread out the days on which full backups occur, or if you need to backup the /home directory on one or more boxes, or if you have specific locations you need to back up as well, then you can managed all these from these four variables.\n\nThe variables `$bacula_backup_includes` and `$bacula_backup_excludes` will, if specificed, create a dedicated `FileSet` for this host and write an override into the per-Client configuration for the Director.\n\n\nFrom there, just add the classes to the node you want backed up:\n\n```puppet\nnode basenode {\n  $bacula_server_password  = \"random_password_one_goes_here\"\n  $bacula_console_password = \"random_password_two_goes_here\"\n  $bacula_director_server  = \"director.bacula.local\"\n  $bacula_storage_server   = \"storage.bacula.local\"\n  $bacula_mail_to          = \"example@example.com\"\n}\n\nnode director inherits basenode {\n  include bacula::director, bacula::console\n}\n\nnode storage inherits basenode {\n  include bacula::storage\n}\n\nnode www1, www2, www3, www4 inherits basenode {\n  include bacula\n}\n\nnode more-storage inherits basenode {\n  include bacula::storage\n}\n\nnode www5, www6, www7, www8 inherits basenode {\n  $bacula_storage_servers = \"more-storage.bacula.local\"\n  include bacula\n}\n\nnode nfs inherits basenode {\n  $bacula_backup_dohome='Yes'\n  $bacula_backup_onday='Friday'\n  include bacula\n}\n\nnode desktop inherits basenode {\n  include bacula::bat\n}\n```\n\nOnce configured, run `puppet agent` on each of the servers to be backed up (`www[0-8]`) and this will export resources (make sure that `storeconfigs = true` is set in the 'puppet.conf' of your 'puppetmasterd') to be run and/or saves on the required servers. Then run it on your Director and Storage Daemons (order here doesn't matter). Puppet will then install a base configuration and export any of the relevent resources it can find.\n\nThis also means that any time you install a new server to be backed up, e.g. `www9`, you need to run `puppet agent` on `www9` first to set up the File Daemon, then run it on the Director and Storage Daemon to install the configuration they require for that server.\n\n\nDEFAULTS\n--------\n\n * A server will be have a full backup on Saturday, of which the first of the month will be a *Full* backup and the other Saturday's being *Differential* (only changes since the last Full or Differential Backup). All mid-week backups will be *Incremental*.\n * In the event of their being a slow- or long-running job, the Director has duplicate handling logic which will always ensure that the most imporant version of the Job (Full > Differental > Incremental) is run (killing a currently running job if required), while for jobs of the same importance, the currently running one is given priority, or if they are both queued, the newest version is kept.\n * All *Incremental* backups will be made at *20:00*, with *Full* backups starting at *18:30* (or *15:30* on Saturday or Sunday).\n * All servers will *not* have their '/home' directory backed up. The assumption is that this is mounted via NFS from a central location and therefore you will use `$bacula_backup_dohome` on the NFS server to back this up as required.\n * The default `FileSet` is as follows:\n\n```\nFileSet {\n  Name = \"Basic:noHome\"\n  Include {\n    File = /boot\n    File = /etc\n    File = /usr/local\n    File = /var\n    File = /opt\n    File = /srv\n  }\n\n  Exclude {\n    File = /var/cache\n    File = /var/tmp\n    File = /var/lib/dpkg\n    File = /var/lib/puppet\n    File = /var/lib/mysql\n    File = /var/lib/postgresql\n    File = /var/lib/ldap\n    File = /var/lib/bacula\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNOTES\n=====\n\n * I haven't created an environment variable to configure the location of the storage as it's not managed by the `bacula::storage` class, but by the `bacula` class - effectively each File Daemon creates it's own location to be added onto the Storage Daemon as part of the resource exporting. This is required so that we create individual `Device`'s for each host so that it will support concurrent streams of data. So long as we only have a single `Device` on a Storage Daemon we can only support a single stream. By fixing it in the code it keeps out issues of changes mid-installation. All Devices will created under `/mnt/bacula/${FQDN}`, so mount your backup file space as `/mnt/bacula` on all Storage Nodes.\n * Although this code is running operationally, it is still very new and it's only been running for a week or so. I will continue to monitor it over the coming weeks and months to make sure that its behaving as I would expect and make any changes required.\n * There is no requirement to have separate Director and Storage Daemon nodes. This module is perfectly happy with having both on the same box. The only restriction is that you cannot install the File Deamon (`include bacula`) on the same box that runs the Director (`include bacula::director`). The Director class installs it's own copy of the File Daemon to manage the backing up of Catalog and this will fail with the `Package['bacula-fd']` having already been defined.\n * Finally, across a Puppet network, the hostnames (for FQDN's) of the Directors, and Storage Daemons must be unique. You cannot at this time have 'director.bacula.com' and 'director.bacula.net' as they will be both processed as just 'director' in parts of the configuration. If there is a pressing need for full FQDN's across all parts of the configuration I will make the changes, but I don't see the need for it at the moment.\n\n\nHELP\n====\n\nIf you have issues with this or can think of ways to improve this, fork or raise an issue. I'm more than happy for others to help out as required. This has been created for a specific need in my office enviroment and therefore it does fit that need. If others can expand on it or improve, I welcome your input!\n"
